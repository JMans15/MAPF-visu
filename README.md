How to use linux and macos:
- install rustup `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- Maybe run `rustup default stable` to be sure
- run cargo run --release anywhere in the directory

If there's a problem:
- I'm very sad
- Cargo should take care of all the dependencies automatically (<3), but I don't know if macos ships a default GTK theme by default (this is a GTK4 app), you may need to install one
